# Temperature Analysis with SQLAlchemy


## Overview of Surfs Up
The purpose of this analysis is to help an entrepreneur present his
business idea to an investor. The business is to start a surf shop
that sells icecream as well. To propose a good business idea data was
collected for temperatures in Oahu, Hawai for one year to determine
the average temperature, max temperature and minimum temperature by
month. The data was then used to determine whether or not Surfs Up would be a 
good business investment.


## Results

- The average monthly temperature for the month of Junne and December are
roughly the same, with June having a mean of 73 and December having a mean of 71.

- The minimum temperature for the month of June is significanlty higher than the 
minimum temperature for the month of December. For the month of June, the minimum
temperature is 64, while the minimum temperature for the month of December is 56.

- The maximum temperatures for the month of June and December are similar, with June
having a maximum temperature of 85 and December having a maximum temperature of 83. 

## Sufs Up Summary
From the data collected and used, it appears that the weather is pretty similar in
both the summer month of June and the winter month of December. With that being said,
it does not appear that sales or business would effected in colder months as opposed 
to warmer months. Since both months have a high max temperature, it can be inferred that
people will still surf in both months and will likely buy ice cream. However, from this
data, it does not show average rainfall per month or take into natural disasters, such as
hurricanes, thunderstorms, tsunamis, etc. Creating a query that captures the average
rainfall per month can help determine how this can also effect the business. In addition,
a query can be created to capture the average number of natural disasters by category,
this will allow the entrepreneur and investor to take in to condieration these factors
as well when devising a business plan.
